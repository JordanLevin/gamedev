FIXED:
issue with mesh poly culling when looking from negative to positive z direction, happens on chunk boundaries: fixed, issue with how chunk space coords were calculated
raycast for block delete is often off: Fixed, issue with how integer values were rounded, needs to be accounted that block edges are at .5 mark rather than integer vals

OPEN:
raycast can skip through block corners
mem leak on remeshing
Window resize does not properly fix the projection matrix
