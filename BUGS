FIXED:
issue with mesh poly culling when looking from negative to positive z direction, happens on chunk boundaries: fixed, issue with how chunk space coords were calculated
raycast for block delete is often off: Fixed, issue with how integer values were rounded, needs to be accounted that block edges are at .5 mark rather than integer vals
raycast can skip through block corners: Used an algorithm from a paper that always hits

OPEN:
selection block isnt being rendered properly after coord system changes
placing blocks no longer works after coord system changes
mem leak on remeshing
Window resize does not properly fix the projection matrix
