OK SO WE DOIN SOME DESIGN HERE:
Issue: Camera, initglut, and scenemanager need to interact:

Idea: SceneManger has a camera instance. Init glut has a scenemanager instance.
So initglut could ask scenemanager for its camera.
    New Issue: glut callbacks cant be members. Potential workaround: create func in initglut that delegate to camera

This worked but theres still a bit too much of objects containing pointers to other objects
